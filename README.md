# balloon shooter 
Imports
The required modules are first imported by the code:

Pygame: This module offers the essential features for setting up and controlling the graphics, input, and game window.

Sys: This module gives you access to commands that are unique to your system, like quitting a program.

random: To determine the balloons' positions and colors, this module offers functions for creating random numbers.

math: This module offers mathematical operations, including the computation of angles for balloon motion.

Playing background music is made possible by the pygame.mixer module.

unittest: This module offers the structure needed to create unit tests.
Setup of the Game

The game environment is set up by the code that follows:

The pygame module is initialized and made ready for use by calling pygame.init().

width = 500: This establishes 500 pixels as the game window's width.

height = 500: This establishes 500 pixels as the game window's height.

The game display window is created with the given width and height by using the expression display = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height)).

The game window's title is changed to "Balloon Shooter" by using the pygame.display.set_caption() function.

pygame.time = clock.Clock(): This generates a clock object for timekeeping and controls the speed of the game.
Looping Game

The main game loop, which continues until the game is stopped, is represented by the following code:

while True:: Until a break statement is encountered, this loop keeps running.

# Check for events: The code that follows looks for user input events is indicated by this comment.

within pygame.event.get() for event:: The events in the event queue are iterated over in this way.

event.type must equal pygame.QUIT:: This determines if Pygame is the event type.QUIT, denoting the user's closure of the game window.

The pygame module is terminated by calling pygame.quit().

System exits the program with sys.exit().

# Update the score display: The code that follows updates the score display, as indicated by this comment.
pygame.font = score_font.Using SysFont('Arial', 24), a font object is created for the score to be displayed.

score_font.render(f"Score: {score}", True, (255, 255, 255)) = score_text This produces the score text in the designated font, color, and anti-aliasing, along with the current score value.

display.blit(score_text, (10, 10)): This creates the score text at the given coordinates (10, 10) on the game display.

# Draw the game elements: According to this comment, the player and balloons are drawn by the following code.

The placeholder #... (Draw balloons, player, etc.) indicates that this is where the actual code for drawing the game elements should be put into practice.

# Update the display: The game display is updated by the code that follows, as indicated by this comment.
'gamemusic-6082 (1).mp3' is what mixer.music.load() does: The background music file loads as a result.
Game Continuities
pygame.display.flip(): This modifies the game display so that the user can see the modifications.

# Restrict the game's speed to 60 frames per second: This comment suggests that the game's speed is restricted to 60 frames per second by the following code.

clock.tick(60): This sets a time limit of at least 1/60th of a second after the last drawn frame to restrict the game's speed to 60 frames per second.

The game's constants are defined in the code that follows:

The margin that surrounds the game window's edges, where balloons cannot be placed, is set with margin = 100.

lowerBound = 100: This establishes the lower bound for balloons' Y-position.

Initialization of Score

The score variable is initialized by the code that follows:

score = 0: This establishes a zero starting score.
The background music is now playing thanks to mixer.music.play().
